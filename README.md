Using Linux commands, we are able to change file/directory permissions for particular users. This lab is meant to demonstrate my personal ability and comfortability with these operations.

<h2>Describe the permissions string</h2>
10-character permission string of file: project_k.txt = -rw-rw-rw- This indicates that in this file, the user,
group, and other are all able to read and write on this file, but not execute.

<h2>Summary:</h2>
The goals of this Lab were as follows: <br />
● View/identify “projects” directory permissions (including hidden files)<br />
● Remove other’s write access to any file<br />
● Change .project_x.txt permissions, so user/group to only read access<br />
● Change ‘drafts’ directory to only allow user access
